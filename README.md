# lein-watcher

A Leiningen plugin to watch and run clojure files which are meant to compiled to another file type. For example: generating html from [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), Creating css from [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden), or creating .csv from clojure code.

## Usage


Put `[lein-watcher "0.3.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Add a configuration to your project.clj specifying the directory to watch, where to place the output and what filetype they should appear as.

Lein watch will watch the directory and call the -main function of whatever files it is monitoring and output then with their name changed in the corresponding directory.
```
:lein-watcher {:input-dir "src/hello-world/svgs/" 
               :output-dir "assets/svgs/"
               :output-type "svg"}

```

Then call
```
$ lein watcher
```
